You look at your payslip and feel a familiar disconnect. The number there doesn't reflect the value you're bringing, or the rising cost of everything from transport to groceries. A thought forms: "I need a raise."</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Then, the dread sets in. The thought of walking into your manager's office and asking for more money can feel terrifying. What if they say no? What if they think you're greedy? What if it backfires?</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph msg msg--highlight"><strong>I want you to reframe this. Asking for a raise is not begging for a favour. It is a professional conversation where you present a business case for your increased value. It’s not about what you <em>need</em> to pay your bills; it’s about what you have <em>earned</em> through your contributions. </strong></p><h4>The Foundation: Building Your Case, Not Your Plea</h4><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Walking in and saying, "Life is expensive, I need more money," will not work. The company doesn't pay you based on your personal expenses. They pay for the value you provide. Your entire strategy is to prove that the value you provide now is significantly greater than the value you provided when your current salary was set.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">This requires evidence, not emotion. You are not a subordinate asking for a gift; you are a business-of-one presenting a proposal to your most important client.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Gather Your Evidence: The Value Dossier</strong></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Start a document—a "Value Dossier"—a month or two before you plan to have the conversation. This is your ammunition. In it, you will collect:</p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Quantifiable Achievements:</strong> What have you done that has made or saved the company money? Did you streamline a process that saved 5 hours a week? Did you land a client worth a certain amount? Did you manage a project that came in under budget? Numbers are your best friend. Use them.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Expanded Responsibilities:</strong> List everything you do now that wasn't in your original job description. Have you taken on training new staff? Are you managing social media accounts that you didn't before? Have you become the go-to person for a specific software? Document this.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Positive Feedback &amp; Testimonials:</strong> Save every "great job!" email from clients, colleagues, or senior leaders. If you have performance reviews with positive comments, have them ready. This is social proof of your value.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Market Research:</strong> What is the market rate for your role? Use salary surveys, websites like Glassdoor, and conversations with recruiters to establish a salary range for someone with your experience, skills, and location. This shows you've done your homework and your request is reasonable.</p></li></ul><h4>The Script: Planning the Conversation</h4><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">You wouldn't go into a client presentation without a plan. Don't go into this conversation without one either.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>1. Schedule a Formal Meeting</strong><br>Don't ambush your manager at the coffee machine or at the end of a stressful day. Send a calm, professional email: "Hi "Manager's Name", I'd like to schedule some time to discuss my career progression and compensation. Would [Date and Time] work for you?" This sets a professional tone.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>2. Open with Gratitude and Shared Goals</strong><br>Start the conversation by framing it positively.</p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>What to say:</strong> "Thank you for making the time to meet. I really enjoy working here and I'm proud of the contributions I've made to the team, especially recently with "mention a key achievement". I'm here today to talk about how I can continue to grow my impact and, in line with that, discuss my compensation."</p></li></ul><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>3. Present Your Case Confidently</strong><br>This is where you use your Value Dossier. Be concise and powerful.</p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>What to say:</strong> "Since my last salary review, I've taken on significant new responsibilities, including [list 1-2 key expanded duties]. I've also delivered on [mention your top 1-2 quantifiable achievements]. Based on my contributions and the market rate for this level of work, which I've researched, I believe a salary of [state your target number] is appropriate."</p></li></ul><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">State the number clearly and then stop talking. The silence that follows is powerful. Let them respond.</p><h4>Navigating Their Response and Objections</h4><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Your manager might not say "yes" immediately. Be prepared for common objections.</p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>"It's not in the budget right now."</strong></p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Your response:</strong> "I understand budget constraints. Can we explore what would be possible in the next quarter? Alternatively, could we discuss a non-monetary benefit, such as additional leave days or a commitment to a review in three months?"</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>"The company isn't giving anyone raises."</strong></p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Your response:</strong> "I appreciate that context. My request is based on my specific contributions and expanded role, which I've documented. Is there a pathway to recognition for high performers, even in a freeze, such as a spot bonus or a title change that would position me for a raise when the freeze lifts?"</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>"That's more than we can offer."</strong></p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Your response:</strong> "I see. What would be a feasible number based on the value I've demonstrated? My research shows the market range for my role is between [X and Y]."</p></li></ul></li></ul><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Always have a "Plan B" in mind. If they absolutely cannot meet your number, what else is valuable? More vacation time? A training budget? A guaranteed promotion track? Know your walk-away point.</p><h4>The Mindset: You Are an Asset, Not a Cost</h4><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">The most important thing you bring into the room is your mindset. You must believe in your own value. If you don't, why should they?</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Practice your talking points out loud. Rehearse with a friend. Visualize a successful outcome. Remember, a company would spend far more time and money recruiting and training your replacement than it would to give you a reasonable raise. You are an appreciating asset. It is in their best interest to retain you.</p><hr><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph msg msg--success">Negotiating a raise is a professional skill, not a personal confrontation. It is the culmination of your hard work, strategically packaged and confidently presented. By shifting your mindset from a supplicant to a valuable partner, and by backing it up with irrefutable evidence of your worth, you transform an anxiety-inducing ordeal into a career-advancing opportunity.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Your first step is to open a new document and title it "My Value Dossier." Start populating it today. Jot down every achievement, every piece of positive feedback, every new responsibility. Do this for the next month. When that file is fat with evidence, you will no longer feel like you're asking for a favour. You'll feel like you're stating a fact.
