The one you get when a cousin or a friend from university lands a new job. You’re happy for them, genuinely. You celebrate together, maybe even toast to their success. But then, the inevitable question pops into your head, the one we’re all thinking but are too polite to ask: “So… what are they paying you?”</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">We never ask. It’s like an unspoken rule. We’ll talk about the job title, the boss, the office location, even the colour of the chairs, but the salary? That secret is locked away tighter than a family recipe.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Now, think about your own job offer. Remember the rush of getting that call? The relief, the pride. Then, the HR manager says the number. Maybe your heart sank a little. Maybe it was just… okay. But you accepted it anyway. Why? Because negotiating felt… uncomfortable. Greedy. Maybe even risky. You didn’t want to seem difficult, so you took what was offered.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">What if I told you that single decision, that moment of uncomfortable silence, could cost you more than you’ll ever imagine? Not just now, but for years to come. Your starting salary isn't just a number; it's the foundation for every single raise, bonus, and even your next job's offer. A smaller base means smaller increments forever. That’s not a scare tactic; it’s simple maths.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">This isn’t about being greedy. It’s about being valued. It’s about aligning your pay with the immense value you bring to a company. And guess what? Everyone is expecting you to do it. Seriously. They’ve built a little cushion into that first offer, waiting to see if you’ll ask for more. Staying silent isn’t being polite; it’s leaving your own money on their table.</p><h3>Why We Freeze When Money is Mentioned</h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Negotiating feels like a confrontation. For many of us, it goes against our cultural grain of being humble and agreeable. We’re taught to be grateful for opportunities, not to challenge them. The fear is palpable: <em>What if they get angry? What if they think I’m arrogant and withdraw the offer?</em></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Well, here’s a secret from the other side of the table. Recruiting is a huge pain. It takes time, energy, and a lot of money. A company doesn’t go through dozens of interviews, tests, and meetings just to throw away a perfect candidate because they politely asked for a better package. It just doesn’t happen. The worst they can say is a polite “no,” and the offer will still stand. You have literally nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Think of it this way: if a market vendor can confidently tell you the price of her tomatoes and stand firm, why can’t you, a skilled professional, state your worth?</p><h3>Your Practical Guide to Confident Salary Negotiations</h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">So, how do you move from fear to confidence? It’s not magic; it’s preparation. You wouldn’t go into an exam without studying, so don’t go into a negotiation without doing your homework.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>1. Arm Yourself With Information (Know Your Market Value)</strong><br>This is your biggest weapon. You can’t just <em>feel</em> you deserve more; you have to <em>know</em> it. This means research, and lots of it.</p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Talk to your network:</strong> This is where those cousins and friends come in. Swallow your pride and have those awkward conversations. Frame it as seeking advice: “I’ve got this offer for a marketing role at X level, and I’m trying to understand what the market rate is to ensure I’m being realistic. Can you share any insights?” You’ll be surprised how many people will help.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Use online resources:</strong> While salary information can be less transparent here, platforms like LinkedIn and some local industry-specific forums can provide clues. Look at job postings that list salary bands.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Consider the entire package:</strong> Salary is just one part. Factor in things like health insurance, pension contributions, annual leave, transport allowance, and bonuses. A slightly lower base salary might be worth it for a fantastic health plan for your family or a massive performance bonus.</p></li></ul><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>2. Craft Your Narrative (Your Value Proposition)</strong><br>Why are you worth more than the initial offer? This isn’t about your bills or your rent. The company doesn’t pay you based on your expenses; they pay you for the value you create.</p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Quantify your achievements:</strong> Did you increase sales by a certain percentage? Did you manage a team that completed projects ahead of schedule? Did you bring in new clients? Use numbers. Instead of “I was good at sales,” say “I grew my sales portfolio by 40% in one year.”</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Connect your skills to their needs:</strong> Revisit the job description. How do your specific skills and experiences directly solve their problems? Tell that story. “You mentioned you need someone to streamline operations; in my previous role, I implemented a new system that reduced reporting time by 15 hours a month.”</p></li></ul><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>3. The Art of the Conversation (It’s a Dialogue, Not a Demand)</strong><br>The way you frame the ask is everything.</p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Express enthusiasm first:</strong> Always start by saying how excited you are about the role and the company. This sets a positive, collaborative tone. “Thank you so much for this offer. I am absolutely thrilled about the opportunity to join the team and I am very confident that I can deliver great value, especially in [mention specific area].”</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Then, transition to the negotiation:</strong> “Based on my experience [mention 1-2 key achievements], and my understanding of the market rate for this level of role, I was wondering if there is any flexibility on the starting salary? I was hoping for a figure closer to [state your target number, which should be 10-20% higher than the offer].”</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Shut up and listen:</strong> After you’ve made your case, stop talking. Let them respond. The silence is powerful.</p></li></ul><h3>What If They Say No?</h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">This is the part everyone fears. But a “no” on the salary isn’t always the end of the discussion.</p><ul><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Negotiate other parts of the package:</strong> “I understand that the salary might be fixed at this stage. Would it be possible to review the offer in six months based on performance? Or perhaps we could look at increasing the transport or housing allowance?” Sometimes, these non-salary benefits are easier for them to adjust.</p></li><li><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>Get it in writing:</strong> If they agree to anything, a future review, a signing bonus, extra leave make sure it’s documented in your official offer letter. A verbal promise is worth nothing.</p></li></ul><h3>You May Ask</h3><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>When is the best time to bring up salary negotiations?</strong></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Wait until you have a formal offer in hand. Once they have explicitly said they want you, your negotiating power is at its peak. They have invested in you and are unlikely to walk away. Bringing it up too early in the interview process can seem like you’re only interested in the money.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>What if I’m already in a job and want a raise?</strong></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">The process is similar. Schedule a meeting with your manager, come prepared with a list of your accomplishments and contributions since your last review (or since you started), and research what the market pays for your role. Frame it as a conversation about your growth and alignment with market value, not a complaint about your current pay.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph"><strong>How do I overcome the fear of seeming ungrateful?</strong></p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Reframe it in your mind. Negotiating is a standard business practice, not a personal affront. A professional company respects candidates who know their worth and can advocate for themselves, it shows confidence and business acumen, which are qualities they want to hire. You are being grateful for the <em>opportunity</em>, not passive about your <em>value</em>.</p><hr><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">Salary negotiations are that rare moment where a thirty-minute conversation can literally change the trajectory of your financial life. That initial number doesn’t just affect your monthly budget; it compounds over your entire career, impacting your savings, your investments, and your peace of mind.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">The hesitation you feel is normal. But you must push through it. Arm yourself with facts, practice your narrative, and walk into that conversation not as someone asking for a favour, but as a professional discussing a business partnership. You have a unique set of skills and experiences that they need. It’s only right that the compensation reflects that.</p><p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">So the next time an offer comes, take a deep breath, remember the market vendor and her tomatoes, and ask for what you’re worth.
